# RAG Implementation for GovChat

This document explains how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been implemented to enhance the GovChat application's ability to provide accurate information about government services.

## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the power of large language models with a knowledge retrieval system. Instead of relying solely on the language model's pre-trained knowledge, RAG:

1. Retrieves relevant information from a curated knowledge base
2. Provides this information as context to the language model
3. Allows the model to generate more accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable responses

## How It Works in GovChat

### Architecture Overview

The RAG implementation consists of:

1. **Knowledge Base**: A collection of markdown documents containing information about government services, organized by category.

2. **Vector Database**: Documents are processed, chunked, and stored in a FAISS vector database for efficient retrieval.

3. **Retrieval Component**: When a user asks a question, the system converts it to a vector and finds the most relevant document chunks.

4. **Generation Component**: The retrieved context is provided to the language model along with the user's query to generate an informed response.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Knowledge Base Structure

The knowledge base is organized as markdown files in the `knowledge_base` directory:
- `dmv_services.md`: Information about DMV services, licenses, vehicle registration, etc.
- `tax_services.md`: Details about state income tax, property taxes, etc.
- `benefits_programs.md`: Information about CalFresh, Medi-Cal, CalWORKs, etc.

#### 2. RAG System (rag_system.py)

The core RAG functionality is implemented in the `RAGSystem` class with these key methods:

- `build_index()`: Processes documents and builds the vector index
- `retrieve_context()`: Finds relevant document chunks for a query
- `generate_response()`: Combines retrieval with generation to answer queries

#### 3. Integration with the Chatbot (views.py)

The Django views have been updated to:
- Initialize the RAG system
- Use it to generate responses with relevant context
- Fall back to standard generation if RAG fails
- Include source information in the response

## How to Use

### Adding to the Knowledge Base

To expand the knowledge base:

1. Create markdown documents following the established format
2. Place them in the `knowledge_base` directory
3. The system will automatically index new documents

### Testing the RAG System

Use the provided test script to see the RAG system in action:

```bash
python test_rag.py
```

This will:
- Build the vector index from the knowledge base
- Run several test queries
- Show retrieved context and generated responses

### Evaluating Performance

To evaluate how well the RAG system is working:

1. Compare responses with and without RAG
2. Check if responses include information from the knowledge base
3. Verify that sources are correctly cited
4. Look for improved accuracy on government service questions

## Benefits of RAG for GovChat

1. **Improved Accuracy**: Responses based on verified information rather than general knowledge
2. **Reduced Hallucinations**: Less risk of generating incorrect information
3. **Source Attribution**: Ability to cite sources for better trust and accountability
4. **Easier Updates**: Knowledge can be updated by modifying markdown files without retraining models
5. **Domain Specificity**: Better handling of government-specific terminology and procedures

## Future Improvements

The RAG system could be enhanced with:

1. **Knowledge Base Expansion**: Add more comprehensive information about government services
2. **Web Scraping Integration**: Automatically collect and index information from official government websites
3. **User Feedback Loop**: Improve retrieval based on user feedback
4. **Multi-modal Support**: Include images, forms, and other non-text content
5. **Query Refinement**: Improve retrieval with query expansion and reformulation
6. **Location-Specific Knowledge**: Organize information by state, county, and city for more localized responses

## Technical Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- LangChain
- FAISS for vector storage
- OpenAI API access for embeddings and completions
- BeautifulSoup and Markdown for document processing
